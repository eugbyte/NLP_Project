neutral,I applied online. I interviewed at ST Engineering.
negative,The process took about 2 weeks. HR did not inform there will be a test. The job scope was very generalized. Interviewers were not interested in hiring and no friendly vibes at all. Really untrained and gave an awkward silence.
negative,I was given an interview date and time after submitting resume. Interview got postponed and there was no follow up even after emailing HR about it. A very bad experience
neutral,I applied online. I interviewed at ST Engineering (Singapore) in March 2020.
negative,"Overall HR did good job to arrange the interview, however the interviewer is the worst one I have met, most questions asked were not relevant to job itself, the interviewer just tried very hard to fail you. Very disapotined that why ST has those kind of people in management role."
neutral,I applied online. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at ST Engineering (Singapore) in February 2020.
neutral,"After an online application, they review my CV and gave me a call regarding being open to other roles other than a Mechanical engineer. They have also told me to head down for an interview 1.5 months after the application date where I met with an HR personnel as well as another senior staff from one of the department."
positive ,"Casual chat in warm office, hiring manager highlight challenges of the job, keen interest in my prior experience but no feedback post interview, appreciative of basic insights expected on the job and contract nature"

negative,"Was asked to attend first round and second round interview within 2 weeks. Thereafter, a call was scheduled with one of the team members. No updates or reply after that despite multiple follow up including calls and emails. Extremely unprofessional. Led me on saying that no response is a positive indication. Found out from other sources that the role was offered to another candidate."
neutral,I applied online. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at ST Engineering (Singapore) in July 2019.
positive ,"Hiring process is fast, gotten offer immediately. However as there will be security clearances, you won't be able to start work immediately. Process takes about 1 month. Interviewers are friendly and willing to share."
